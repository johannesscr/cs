**What is good code?**

1. Readable [Coding Practises]
2. Scalable [Big O: Time, Space]

**What is good software?**

[bigocheatsheet.com](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) visualises the scalability
of Big O, as well as common data structure and algorithms and their Big O
notation for each. Showing which data structures are better suited for certain 
operations and algorithms.

This brings us to the conclusion that to write good software means
```â€º
data structure + algorithm = good software
```
Choosing the correct data structure and algorithms for your software to make it
more efficient. With the probable perks that in future it may help other
engineers and developers to understand/grasp/maintain and improve the algorithm.

**Hero Stories**
1. Technical
2. Success
3. Leadership
4. Challenge

**Tell me about yourself**
- Your triggers of success.
- Mention things you want to get asked.
- Skills should be relevant to the job.

How you went from not having much skill to becoming very skilled.

**Secret Weapon**
- Simplicity over complexity.
  - Readable and maintainable.
- Premature optimisation is the root of all evil.
- Overall goal, not myopic (focused on one thing).
- Technical debt and refactoring.
- No complaining about clients/code/coworkers/etc..
- No ego!
